## ❓ Problem Statement
🔹 In a large city, finding a lost child can be extremely difficult. 
🔹 Parents often have to file formal complaints and wait for long durations, making the process inefficient.

📱 This project provides an efficient mobile and web-based application to help locate lost children quickly. Parents can search for their missing child by uploading images or entering details. 

💾 The system contains a database that stores and retrieves missing person information efficiently.
